# Stomatic Clot Web Framework

Creating web framework from scratch for fun and learning. Written in NodeJS and ES6.

Don't know yet where is this gonna be going. So, stay tune.

Basic features:

* Listen and serving HTTP
* Simple routing?

This framework very opinionated. So for example you hit `http://localhost:6543/authentication/create?username=username&password=secret` in browser, they will execute `lib/authentication.js` and method name `create`.

## Why The Name?

No specific reason, just use [this random name generator](http://watchout4snakes.com/wo4snakes/Random/RandomPhrase)
